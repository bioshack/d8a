<p>This week in science: collaboration employs artificial intelligence to find anti-aging drugs; study seeks to uncover genetic components of complex neurological disorders; acquisition will allow mining of genomic databases with machine learning; researchers use the skin to deliver treatments for diseases such as Diabetes.</p>

<h4><a href="http://sciencebusiness.technewslit.com/?p=31423" target="_blank">University, Company Employ AI for Anti-Aging Drugs</a></h4>

<p>The medical analytics company <a href="http://insilicomedicine.com" target="_blank">Insilico Medicine</a> is partnering with the <a href="http://healthsciences.ku.dk/news/2017/08/artificial-intelligence-can-stop-premature-aging" target="_blank">University of Copenhagen</a> to apply artificial intelligence to find new treatments for diseases associated with early aging, including Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>

<h4><a href="http://sciencebusiness.technewslit.com/?p=31436" target="_blank">Study Underway of Depression, Bipolar Disorder Genetics</a></h4>

<p>A large-scale study by two companies and a think tank started enrolling participants to learn more about the role of genetics in major depressive and bipolar disorders. The research project is recruiting some 25,000 participants, carried out by the personal genetics enterprise <a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/press-releases/23andme-launches-first-kind-study-major-depressive-bipolar-disorders" target="_blank">23andMe</a>, working with pharmaceutical company <a href="http://investor.lundbeck.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1035525" target="_blank">H. Lundbeck A/S</a>, and the <a href="http://www.milkeninstitute.org/blog/view/1213" target="_blank">Milken Institute</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="http://sciencebusiness.technewslit.com/?p=31448" target="_blank">Genomics Company Acquires Open-Source Biomedical Platform</a></h4>

<p>A company providing whole genome analysis is acquiring an enterprise developing open-source computational software for biomedical uses, such as precision medicine. The acquisition of <a href="https://curoverse.com" target="_blank">Curoverse</a> in Somerville, Massachusetts is expected to give <a href="https://www.veritasgenetics.com/content/veritas-curoverse-release" target="_blank">Veritas Genetics</a> in Boston the capability to conduct analyses with artificial intelligence using Arvados, Curoverse&#8217;s data management system.</p>

<h4><a href="http://sciencebusiness.technewslit.com/?p=31455" target="_blank">Gene-Edited Skin Grafts Shown to Control Glucose Levels</a></h4>

<p>Skin grafts derived from genetically edited stem cells were shown in tests with lab mice to reduce glucose levels and weight gain that result from a high-fat diet. Results of research by a team from University of Chicago medical center appear in the journal <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(17)30274-6?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1934590917302746%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"><em>Cell Stem Cell</em></a>.</p>
