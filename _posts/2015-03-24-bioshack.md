**BioShack** was founded by <a href="http://d8a.org/people/megan">Megan</a> in early 2011 at the beginning of the open science movement and was one of the first biohackerspaces in the San Francisco Bay Area. It became a business incubator and think tank where bioneers and citizen scientists came together to build apps and hacks that better our world. The organization supported a DIY culture where information and technology were shared freely for the purpose of developing socially responsible solutions. Many of the <a href="http://d8a.org/projects">projects</a> here at D8A came out of that original idea accelerator and members of this "citizen science brigade" are still active in the community.
